# What to ask your interviewers

> **Presenter:** Andrew Hedges

> **Homework:** Please spend at least 45 minutes watching the video below then listing helpful/harmful attributes of previous workplaces.

It’s common practice when interviewing for tech jobs for your interviewers to leave some time at the end of the interview for you to ask them questions.

What you ask and how you word your questions can reflect either positively or negatively on you as a candidate, so it’s important to think through this part of the interview in advance!

## Reflect on previous workplaces

Reflect on positive and negative experiences that you’ve had in previous jobs. Write down a list of helpful and harmful aspects of those workplaces. This could have to do with your manager, the organization’s leadership, the product or service being provided, your coworkers, your team’s processes, or even expectations that they had.

## Develop questions based on your reflections

What do you want to know to help you make an informed decision about whether you want to work at this place? These questions typically revolve around the team, your manager, the product or service, and the company itself.

> **Note:** It is totally valid to want to know things like the salary range, the company’s time off policy, how health and other benefits work, etc. Those questions are better suited for a recruiter or HR/people operations representative than a hiring manager or fellow developer.

## Attend the Q&A about your questions (optional)

If it would be helpful to get feedback on your questions and hear what questions others came up with, join the optional debrief/Q&A on Xyz 99 @ 99pm Pacific.
